**4 Band Shifter** is a VST Plugin that is able to scale (shift) independently the pitch of 4 adjacent, user-definable frequency bands. Plugin pitch-shifting algorithm is based on Stephan M. Bernsee's article, Pitch Shifting Using Fourier Transform.

Plugin uses the FFTW library.

This plugin was hastily coded just after I graduated in CS. It used to be a VC 2005 project. Developers are needed to help mantain the code, add features and refactor. I don't actively mantain this project.
